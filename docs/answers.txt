Reasons for Using Branches:
Isolating features for easier management.
Enabling parallel development without messing up the main code.

Difference Between git log and git status:
git log: Shows the history of commits.
git status: Displays the current state of the repo, like what's staged and what's not.

Command to See Commits for 'Vehicle.h':
Command: git log -- Vehicle.h

Command to See Commits with 'file' in the Message:
Command: git log --grep='file'

Object-Oriented Programming Concepts:
Inheritance: Enables a class to use another class's methods and fields.
Polymorphism: Allows an object to be treated as an instance of its parent class.
Encapsulation: The bundling of data with methods that operate on it.

Dictator and Lieutenants vs Integration Manager:
Dictator and Lieutenants: Central repo with lieutenants managing sub-repos.
Integration Manager: Central repo, developers have their own, a manager integrates changes.

How would a team of 100 developers benefit from following the “Dictator and Lieutenants” workflow instead of the “Centralized” workflow? 
Easier to manage large codebases and multiple features.
Efficient handling of pull requests and code reviews.
